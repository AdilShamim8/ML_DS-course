# > Day 7 Day 14: The Final Boss (Algorithmic Logic)

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.1 Capstone: Two Sum (O(N))
**Goal:** Find two numbers in a list that add up to Target.  
**Deep Dive:** Naive: Nested Loops ($O(N^2)$). Pro: Use a Dictionary (Seen Map). Calculate `needed = target - current`. If needed is in map, you win.

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.2 Capstone: The Palindrome (Slicing)
**Goal:** Check if a string is a palindrome (ignoring space/case).  
**Deep Dive:** Clean string → `s == s[::-1]`. Slicing creates a reversed copy in memory.

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.3 Capstone: Anagrams (Frequency)
**Goal:** Are "silent" and "listen" anagrams?  
**Deep Dive:** 1. Sort both ($O(N \log N)$). 2. Count frequencies: `{'s':1, 'i':1...}` ($O(N)$). Use `collections.Counter`.

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.4 Capstone: Flattening (Recursion)
**Goal:** Flatten `[1, [2, [3, 4]]]` into `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
**Deep Dive:** Write a recursive function. If item is list → recurse. Else → yield.

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.5 Capstone: FizzBuzz (The Logic Gate)
**Goal:** Print 1-100. Div by 3 "Fizz", by 5 "Buzz", both "FizzBuzz".  
**Deep Dive:** Order matters! Check `% 15` (both) FIRST. If you check 3 first, "FizzBuzz" numbers will just print "Fizz".

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.6 Capstone: Deduplication ($O(N)$)
**Goal:** Remove duplicates from a list while keeping order.  
**Deep Dive:** `list(set(x))` destroys order. Solution: Iterate, check if item in `seen_set`, if not $\rightarrow$ append to result.

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.7 Capstone: Binary Search ($O(\log N)$)
**Goal:** Find index of number in sorted list.  
**Deep Dive:** Check middle. If too low, eliminate left half. If too high, eliminate right half. Repeat. Much faster than scanning.

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.8 Capstone: Missing Number (Math)
**Goal:** List 1 to 100 is missing one number. Find it.  
**Deep Dive:** Don't scan. Calculate Expected Sum $\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$. Subtract Actual Sum. The difference is the missing number.

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.9 Capstone: Grouping (Itertools)
**Goal:** Group list of dicts by "category".  
**Deep Dive:** Use `itertools.groupby`. Note: Data MUST be sorted by the key first!

---

### 📖 DEEP DIVE: 14.10 Capstone: Merge Sorted Lists
**Goal:** Combine two sorted lists into one sorted list ($O(N)$).  
**Deep Dive:** Two Pointers. Compare head of A and head of B. Take smaller. Move pointer. Repeat.
