# > Day 9: Infinite Memory (Generators)

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.1 Micro-Challenge: The Basic Yield

**Goal:** Write a function `gen()` that yields 1, then 2, then 3. Loop through it.

**Deep Dive:** Unlike `return`, `yield` pauses the function and saves the **Stack Frame** (local variables) in RAM. The function is "frozen" until you call it again.

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.2 Micro-Challenge: The Memory Profile

**Goal:** Compare `sys.getsizeof()` of a List Comprehension vs a Generator Expression for 1 million numbers.

**Deep Dive:** `[x for x in range(1M)]` consumes ~8MB RAM (stores all numbers). `(x for x in range(1M))` consumes ~100 Bytes (stores only the logic).

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.3 Micro-Challenge: The Infinite Sequence

**Goal:** Write a `while True` generator that produces Fibonacci numbers forever.

**Deep Dive:** This is impossible with a standard list (RAM would fill up). Generators allow **Infinite Data Streams** because they process one item at a time (Lazy Evaluation).

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.4 Micro-Challenge: The One-Time Trap

**Goal:** Create a generator `g`. Loop through it once. Try to loop through it again.

**Deep Dive:** Generators are **Exhaustible**. Once iterated, the "cursor" is at the end. You cannot rewind a generator; you must re-instantiate it.

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.5 Micro-Challenge: The Next Protocol

**Goal:** Manually call `next(gen)` until it crashes.

**Deep Dive:** When a generator runs out of items, it raises a **StopIteration** exception. `for` loops catch this exception silently to stop looping.

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.6 Micro-Challenge: The Pipeline (Chaining)

**Goal:** Create two generators: one squares numbers, the other filters evens. Chain them: `filter(square(nums))`.

**Deep Dive:** This creates a **Data Pipeline**. Data flows from source → square → filter one item at a time. No intermediate lists are created in RAM.

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.7 Micro-Challenge: The Large File Reader

**Goal:** Write a generator to read a "fake" 100GB file line-by-line.

**Deep Dive:** Using `yield line` allows you to process datasets larger than your machine's physical RAM. This is the standard for Big Data processing in Python.

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.8 Micro-Challenge: Yield From

**Goal:** Write a generator that yields values from two different sub-generators using `yield from`.

**Deep Dive:** `yield from` delegates the generator operation to another sub-generator. It flattens nested structures efficiently without manual loops.

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.9 Micro-Challenge: The Send Method

**Goal:** Use `gen.send(value)` to inject data *into* a running generator.

**Deep Dive:** Generators can be two-way streets. `val = yield` pauses and waits to receive data from the outside world. This is the basis for Coroutines (AsyncIO).

---

## 📖 DEEP DIVE: 9.10 Micro-Challenge: State Retention

**Goal:** Write a generator that calculates a "Running Average".


**Deep Dive:** The generator remembers the `total` and `count` variables between yields. This eliminates the need for global variables or class attributes.
